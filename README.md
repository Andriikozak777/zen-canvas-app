Game Modes:

Free Play: Total creative freedom! Simply move your mouse or finger across the canvas to create streams of particles accompanied by a soothing background melody. Perfect for self-expression and meditation.

Echo Sphere: Press and hold the mouse or your finger on the canvas to create a sound sphere. The longer you hold, the longer the note plays, while particles burst outward, forming a mesmerizing visual effect. Release to stop the sound.

Melodic Maze: Embark on a musical adventure! Glide your mouse or finger along the winding blue path of the maze to hear a unique, randomly generated melody. The maze changes each time, offering a fresh sonic experience.

Customization Options:

Visual Effects Settings: Adjust the size, speed, quantity, and lifespan of particles to craft your own distinctive style. Choose from different particle shapes (circles, squares, triangles) and movement types (random, spiral, wave).

Instrument Switching: Experiment with various musical instruments for background melodies and interactive sounds — from classic piano to futuristic synthesizers.

Theme Toggle: Switch between dark and light UI themes to match your preferences and lighting conditions.

Language Selection: Choose your preferred interface language — Russian, Ukrainian, or English.

Volume Control: Set the melody volume to your comfort level.

Melody Tempo: Change the tempo of the background music to suit your mood.
